    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 24, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how ChienNB ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of our mobile applications (the "Apps" or "Games").</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data, if any, is collected and how we use it, particularly concerning the display of advertisements.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We DO NOT Collect</h2>

    <p>We want to emphasize that we **DO NOT** collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from users of our Apps. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your phone number</li>
        <li>Your home address</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or contacts</li>
        <li>Financial or payment information (In-app purchases are processed securely by Google Play)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Collected for Advertising Purposes (By Google AdMob)</h2>

    <p>To support the development and maintenance of our free Apps, we use third-party advertising services provided by Google AdMob.</p>

    <p>When you use our Apps, Google AdMob may collect certain non-personal data to serve relevant ads and measure ad effectiveness. This data may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Identifier:</strong> A unique, resettable, anonymous identifier provided by your device (e.g., Google Advertising ID - GAID on Android).</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> May be used to estimate the general geographic location of a device to serve region-appropriate ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic technical device information:</strong> Device type, operating system, manufacturer, language settings, mobile carrier.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad interaction information:</strong> Data about the ads you have viewed or clicked on (e.g., for frequency capping).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The collection and use of this data are governed by Google's Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review their policies here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and how Google uses data when you use partners' sites or apps here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</p>

    <p>We, ChienNB, do not have direct access to or control over the advertising identifiers or other data collected by AdMob for their advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>

    <p>Data collected by Google AdMob (as described in Section 2) is primarily used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve advertisements within our Apps.</li>
        <li>Deliver personalized (based on interests inferred from anonymized data) or non-personalized ads.</li>
        <li>Measure ad performance and provide aggregated reporting.</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and ensure the security of the advertising platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not share any data you provide (as we do not collect personal data) with any third parties, except for the data collection by Google AdMob as described above for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. User Choices Regarding Personalized Advertising</h2>

    <p>You have control over receiving personalized advertising. You can opt-out of interest-based advertising by adjusting the settings on your mobile device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Open "Google Settings" -> Select "Ads" -> Enable the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" option. You can also choose to "Reset advertising ID" here.</li>
        <!-- If you also develop for iOS, uncomment this section:
        <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> Go to "Settings" -> "Privacy" -> "Advertising" -> Turn on "Limit Ad Tracking".</li>
        -->
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that opting out does not mean you will no longer see ads, only that the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our Apps are **NOT** designed for or targeted at children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information (despite us not requesting it), please contact us at the email address below so we can delete the information.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>

    <p>Although we do not collect personal data, we and our service partners (Google AdMob) implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the collected data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
